# Research progress


## 2024
### July 24 - 31

* Plan for next week
  * Task 1: x
  * Task 2: x


## 2024
### July 17 - 24

* What is new: 
  * New math: Derived RAD form for pfpJ - > pfpJ
  * New code: Almost done with the resolvent vector optimization. 

* What is the roadblock:

* Plan for next week
  * Task 1: Finish derivation of resolvent vector adjoint (Rbar).
  * Task 2: Aeroelastic simulation different $\alpha,\omega$.
  * Task 3: Rewrite Diff SVD paper. Bring copies to edit.
  * Task 4: Rewrite resolvent paper added content as per discussion.
  * Task 5: Rewrite code as per repo guidelines

## 2024
### July 24 - 31
* What is new:
  * Attended workshop on July 25. (DAFOAM). Workshop had lots of researchers from different univs.
  * DA-FOAM session: Key take aways:
    * A common topic of application was ML-"Field Inversion" application to turbulence modeling and prediction accuracy.
    * Many used BFS and NASA-Hump cases to validate predictions
    * What was interesting is in the second talk of generalizable data driven turbulence modeling (SST level), the data set they trained on was actually pretty  small. Yet, they got a good prediction and their alebraic model which modifies the SST model gave better predictions in separation point in the flows.
    * Most used DA FOAM for aerodynamic shape optimization. In fact, there was one speaker from MDO LAB Michigan
    * Field inversion based ML is now incorporated into the DA FOAM package
    * There are some issues in the compressible flow (supersonic regime and shockwave capture issues)
    * Looks like our class of problems are picking up pace very quickly and we have a great topic to work on
