* Plan for next week
  * Task 1: x
  * Task 2: x


## 2024
### July 17 - 24

* What is new: 
  * New math, derive equations, $a, b, c, d$.
    * $\bar{A} = \frac{1}{2}{u_1 v_1^* \bar{\sigma}}^c$
  * New code (new features added, bug-fix, etc.)
  * Writing progress (paper writing)
  * New results (figures)

* What is the roadblock:

* Plan for next week
  * Task 1: Finish derivation of resolvent vector adjoint (Rbar).
  * Task 2: Aeroelastic simulation different $\alpha,\omega$.
  * Task 3: Rewrite Diff SVD paper. Bring copies to edit.
