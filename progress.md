* What is new: 
  * New math: Derived RAD form for pfpJ - > pfpJ
  * New code: Almost done with the resolvent vector optimization. 

* What is the roadblock:

* Plan for next week
  * Task 1: Finish derivation of resolvent vector adjoint (Rbar).
  * Task 2: Aeroelastic simulation different $\alpha,\omega$.
  * Task 3: Rewrite Diff SVD paper. Bring copies to edit.
  * Task 4: Rewrite resolvent paper added content as per discussion.
  * Task 5: Rewrite code as per repo guidelines
